Durring the Master of Science in Engineering the students have to absolvate two seminars.
The goal of these is to elaborate a theme on their own, discuse the result in group and write a paper about the topic.

The Databasesystems Seminar does a focus on streams and how to do processing on them.
Stream processing is a strong growing subject in reference to the huge amount of data we are exposed and produce nowadays.

A big force in generating data is the rapidly increasing amount of Internet of Things sensors,
the willingness of the people to populate a lot of personal information on social media platforms and
also the expanding interest in data collection of companies.
Furthermore that leads to new business models with free products or services,
but unfortunately there ain't no such thing as a free lunch, the private data you are sharing with these companies is the payment.

With the huge amount of data new problems in collecting, processing and storing appear.
Thus new solutions and technical tools to solve them appear too.
