\section{Repositories}
For the implementation part I used different Github repositories to store the code.
And help guide the user how to deploy and install the applications.

\subsection{OSMstream}
The \fnurl{OSMstream}{http://storm.apache.org/releases/2.0.0-SNAPSHOT/Setting-up-a-Storm-cluster.html}   repository provides a docker container which collects the augmented diffs from OpenStreetMap.
The diffs are provided in XML format and can be accessed over the overpass API.

\subsection{storm}
\fnurl{storm}{https://github.com/Murthy10/storm} is the main repository and hosts the Apache Storm implementation code with all the queries and a docker container for a simple usage.

\subsection{StormBoard}
The \fnurl{storm}{https://github.com/Murthy10/StormBoard} is a simple live streaming web dasboard to visualise the queries.
It is based on a NodeJs server, Socket.io for realtime data exchange and Angular 2.0 on the client side.

\section{Apache Storm}
To set up a Apache Storm Cluster I recommend you to use the official and up to date
\fnurl{documentation}{http://storm.apache.org/releases/2.0.0-SNAPSHOT/Setting-up-a-Storm-cluster.html}.
